Electronic address: jiebai662001@126.com.AbstractParkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra(SNpc), characteristic motor symptoms and cognitive impairment. Thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) is a redox protein and protects neurons from various injuries. Our previous study has shown that Trx-1 overexpression attenuates movement disorder in PD. However, whether Trx-1 ameliorates cognitive deficits in PD is still unknown. In the present study, we investigated the effects of Trx-1 on learning and memory in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD model in mice. We demonstrated that deficits in learning and memory were induced by MPTP in mice through the elevated plus-maze test. We found that the retention transfer latency time was shorten, escape latency was decreased and the number of platform crossings was increased in the Morris water maze (MWM) in Trx-1 transgenic (TG) mice when compared with wild type mice. The expressions of tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) and dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) were decreased by MPTP, which were restored in Trx-1 TG mice. The expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2B subunit (NR2B), the levels of phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) in the hippocampus were decreased by MPTP, which were reversed in Trx-1 TG mice. These results suggest that Trx-1 ameliorates learning and memory deficits in MPTP-induced PD model in mice via modulating the D1R and the NMDAR-ERK1/2-CREB pathway. Trx-1 may be a therapy target for learning and memory deficits in PD.KEYWORDS: Hippocampus; Learning and memory deficits; Parkinson's disease; Thioredoxin-1PMID: 29960099 DOI: 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2018.06.029 Share\n",

It still remains unclear whether MANF can rescue dopaminergic (DA) neurons in an α-synuclein model. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and its related neurturin (NRTN) can protect DA neurons in the neurotoxin but not α-synuclein animal models of PD, it failed in the clinical trials. Since α-synuclein model can better mimic the progression of human PD, in our study we overexpressed MANF specifically in DA neurons by using an α-synuclein Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) model. Our results showed MANF alleviated progressive neuronal degeneration and prevented locomotion defects. Indeed, MANF can protect cilia of DA neurons at an early stage, suggested that MANF participated in the whole process of neuronal degeneration. Furthermore, we found MANF facilitated the removal of misfolded α-synuclein proteins and rescued the function of damaged DA neurons. By using RNAi approach, we inhibited ER stress and autophagy related genes and MANF effects were decreased, which demonstrated ER stress and autophagy pathways were involved in the MANF-mediated neuroprotection. Our study suggests MANF exhibits potential as a neuroprotective agent for PD therapy.KEYWORDS: Autophagy; C. elegans; Calcium; ER stress; MANF; Neuroprotection; Parkinson's disease; α-synucleinPMID: 29959908 DOI: 10.1016/j.expneurol.2018.06.016 Share\n",

Rank orders were reassessed at 2 times after DBS. Changes in rank order over time were examined with χ2 analyses. The relationships between change in symptom severity/limits to behavioral goal attainment and change in rank order were examined with mixed-effects linear regression models.RESULTS: Most participants changed the rank order of their symptom (81%) and behavioral (77%) goals 3 months after DBS surgery. Change in rank order of symptom goals was significantly related to change in severity ratings such that improvements in self-reported symptom severity were associated with reductions in rank. In contrast, no such relationship was evident for the behavioral goals.CONCLUSION: These data illustrate how patients' primary goals for DBS shift early in stimulation and highlight the important differences between symptom and behavioral goals. Changes in the rank order of symptom goals were related to changes in symptom severity, whereas subtler shifts in behavioral goals were unrelated to improvements after DBS. This observation suggests that DBS does not affect goals that may be more reflective of core personal values. The findings provide empiric data that can help improve the informed consent process.© 2018 American Academy of Neurology.PMID: 29959262 DOI: 10.1212/WNL.0000000000005917 Share\n",

Symptoms typically manifest within a few days, and 90% of cases emerge within 3 months. The patient was a 68-year-old white man with a past psychiatric history significant for bipolar I versus cyclothymic disorder. The patient presented with pressured speech, flight of ideas, distractibility, delusions, and disorganized thinking. He was started on risperidone and, due to a subclinical response, was cross-tapered from risperidone to olanzapine, and divalproex was started. The patient was then given paliperidone 234 mg long-acting injection (LAI) and a second loading dose of 156 mg 1 week later. The patient's cognitive and functional status subsequently declined, all neuroleptics were discontinued, and he was diagnosed with drug-induced parkinsonism. After a complicated hospital course the patient died approximately 5 months after the administration of paliperidone LAI. Although there are several confounding factors, due to the temporal relationship of events it is likely that paliperidone LAI was a contributing factor for the development of severe parkinsonism. Practitioners should be cognizant of the potential long-term consequences of paliperidone LAI.KEYWORDS: Invega Sustenna®; Parkinson disease; antipsychotic; divalproex; drug-induced parkinsonism; long-acting injection; paliperidone; parkinsonismPMID: 29955500 PMCID: PMC6007667 DOI: 10.9740/mhc.2017.03.065 Share\n",

Prior to this clinic, there was no involvement of a clinical pharmacy specialist (CPS) in the outpatient neurology clinic at the West Palm Beach Veterans Affairs Medical Center. This was a prospective, quality-improvement project to develop a clinical pharmacist-run neurology telephone clinic and evaluate pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions in an effort to improve the quality of care for patients with PD. Additionally, the CPS conducted medication education groups to 24 patients with PD and their caregivers, if applicable, at this medical center with the purpose of promoting patient knowledge and medication awareness. Medication management was performed via telephone rather than face to face. Only patients with a concomitant mental health diagnosis for which they were receiving at least one psychotropic medication were included for individual visits due to the established scope of practice of the CPS being limited to mental health and primary care medications. Data collection included patient and clinic demographics as well as pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions made for patients enrolled from January 6, 2017, through March 31, 2017. A total of 49 pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions were made for 10 patients. We successfully implemented and evaluated a clinical pharmacist-run neurology telephone clinic for patients with PD.

Ketchum University, Fullerton, California; Professor, Department of Neurology, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, California, jchen@ketchum.edu.AbstractPersistent psychotic symptoms will develop in up to 60% of patients with Parkinson disease (PD). The initial approach to the management of PD psychosis (PDP) begins with addressing concurrent systemic conditions associated with psychotic behavior, such as delirium, medical conditions (eg, infections), psychiatric disorders (eg, major depression with psychotic symptoms, mania, schizophrenia), and substance misuse or withdrawal. A review of current medications is recommended, and medications that may trigger psychotic symptoms should be eliminated. If possible, antiparkinson medications should be reduced to the minimum therapeutic dose or discontinued in a sequential manner. Generally, dose reduction or discontinuation of anticholinergics is attempted first, followed by that of monoamine oxidase B inhibitors, amantadine, dopamine agonists, catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors, and lastly carbidopa/levodopa. The aim of antiparkinson medication dose reduction is to achieve a balance between improving drug-related psychotic symptoms and not significantly worsening the motor symptoms of PD. If additional measures are needed for chronic PDP treatment, the use of second-generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine, pimavanserin, or quetiapine, must be considered. The first-generation antipsychotics (eg, fluphenazine, haloperidol) are not recommended. In the patient with comorbid dementia, the addition of a cholinesterase inhibitor might also be beneficial for PDP. The choice of agent is based on patient-specific parameters, potential benefit, and side effects.KEYWORDS: Parkinson disease; antipsychotics; clozapine; movement disorders; nonmotor symptoms; pimavanserin; psychosis; quetiapinePMID: 29955532 PMCID: PMC6007727 DOI: 10.9740/mhc.2017.11.262 ShareConflict of interest statementDisclosures: J.J.C. is on the Speaker's Bureau for ACADIA Pharmaceuticals.

There is limited research on the lived experience of hallucinations among affected individuals and therefore a lack of evidence-based management strategies. This study used qualitative methods to explore the VH experience of individuals with dementia or Parkinson's disease and their informal caregivers.METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 individuals with VHs and dementia and 11 informal caregivers, and 11 individuals with VHs and Parkinson's disease and 9 informal caregivers. Interviews were analysed using an inductive thematic approach.RESULTS: Three themes emerged from the data: \"Insight and distress,\" \"Caregiver approach: challenging v reassurance,\" and \"Normality and stigma.\" Insight appeared to affect whether hallucinations were perceived as threatening and whether acceptance occurred over time. Emotional reactions and management strategies varied as insight changed with disease progression. Concerns around stigmatisation negatively influenced help-seeking and acceptance of the hallucinations.CONCLUSIONS: Degree of insight and cognitive ability appear fundamental to the lived experience of hallucinations. Irrespective of the clinical context, support in early stages should focus on raising awareness of VH, symptom disclosure, stigma reduction, and contact with others affected. In later stages, the focus shifts to informal caregiver needs and a flexible approach to reassuring those affected.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.KEYWORDS: Parkinson's disease; dementia; qualitative methods; visual hallucinationsPMID: 29953689 DOI: 10.1002/gps.4929 ShareLinkOut - more resourcesFull Text SourcesWiley\n",

Electronic address: livia.civitelli@liu.se.AbstractParkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies are characterized by accumulation of misfolded aggregates of α-synuclein (α-syn). The normal function of α-syn is still under investigation, but it has been generally linked to synaptic plasticity, neurotransmitter release and the maintenance of the synaptic pool. α-Syn localizes at synaptic terminals where it can bind to synaptic vesicles as well as to other cellular membranes. It has become clear that these interactions have an impact on both α-syn functional role and its propensity to aggregate. In this study, we investigated the aggregation process of α-syn covalently modified with 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE). HNE is a product of lipid peroxidation and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of different neurodegenerative diseases by modifying the kinetics of soluble toxic oligomers. Although HNE-modified α-syn has been reported to assemble into stable oligomers, we found that slightly acidic conditions promoted further protein aggregation. Lipid vesicles delayed the aggregation process in a concentration-dependent manner, an effect that was observed only when they were added at the beginning of the aggregation process. Co-aggregation of lipid vesicles with HNE-modified α-syn also induced cytotoxic effects on differentiated SHSY-5Y cells. Under conditions in which the aggregation process was delayed cell viability was reduced. By exploring the behavior and potential cytotoxic effects of HNE-α-syn under acidic conditions in relation to protein-lipid interactions our study gives a framework to examine a possible pathway leading from a physiological setting to the pathological outcome of PD.KEYWORDS: Aggregation kinetics; Lipids; Parkinson's disease; Toxicity; α-SynucleinPMID: 29960040 DOI: 10.1016/j.bbadis.2018.06.020 Share\n",

Although remission can occur in ICB, only four reports on the ratio of remission and the persistence of ICB have been published, and the associated factors with ICB remission or persistence have been little known. Therefore, we conducted a longitudinal assessment of the remission, persistence, and development of ICB and those associated factors in patients with PD.METHODS: We retrospectively investigated a PD database at Aomori Prefectural Central Hospital, Japan. One hundred and forty-eight patients with PD who could be followed up for 2 years were enrolled. ICB was assessed using the Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's disease. Motor severity (Hoehn and Yahr scale and United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale), cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination), and other clinical variables (sex, age, onset age, disease duration, olfactory dysfunction, and dyskinesia) and medications used to treat PD were assessed. Univariate analyses were performed.RESULTS: Seven patients were excluded because of the exclusion criteria, and 141 patients were analyzed. Thirty patients (21.3%) had ICB at baseline, and these patients also had significantly higher use of pergolide. The ICB remission rate was 60%, the ICB persistence ratio was 40%, and the ICB development ratio was 12.6% over 2 years. Statistically, younger age and pergolide use were associated with ICB persistence. Being male, having dyskinesia, and rotigotine, entacapone, zonisamide, and istradefylline use were associated with ICB development.CONCLUSION: This study suggests that younger age and pergolide use may be the new associated factors with ICB persistence and that entacapone, zonisamide, and istradefylline use may be associated with the development of ICB. Drug profiles and medication practices in Japan may explain the association of these factors with ICB.© 2018 The Authors.

The antipsychotic effects of this new agent are believed to occur via selective inverse agonist activity at serotonin 5-HT2a receptors.Methods: Study authors completed a literature review of 2 published randomized controlled trials of pimavanserin for the treatment of Parkinson disease psychosis. The Food and Drug Administration Briefing Document by the Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee for the review of pimavanserin dated March 29, 2016, was reviewed for additional information on 2 unpublished trials.Results: Pimavanserin has demonstrated no worsening of motor symptoms of Parkinson disease, but only 1 of 4 trials has shown consistent statistically significant improvements in psychotic symptoms compared with placebo.Discussion: Options for the treatment of Parkinson disease psychosis are limited. The selective receptor profile of pimavanserin offers advantages for tolerability. Further studies are warranted to better provide clinicians and patients with information regarding the clinical utility of this agent.KEYWORDS: Parkinson disease; Pimavanserin; psychosisPMID: 29955528 PMCID: PMC6007714 DOI: 10.9740/mhc.2017.09.230 ShareConflict of interest statementDisclosures: The authors have nothing to disclose in terms of financial conflict of interest.\n",

Severity of ataxia was assessed using the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) and neurological symptoms other than ataxia with the Inventory of Non-Ataxia Signs (INAS).RESULTS: UHDRS-IV [SCA1: - 1.35 (0.12); SCA2: - 1.15 (0.11); SCA3: - 1.16 (0.11); SCA6: - 0.99 (0.12)] and EQ-5D [SCA1: - 2.88 (0.72); SCA2: - 1.97 (0.49); SCA3: - 2.06 (0.55); SCA6: - 1.03 (0.57)] decreased linearly, whereas PHQ-9 increased [SCA1: 0.15 (0.04); SCA2: 0.09 (0.03); SCA3: 0.06 (0.04); SCA6: 0.07 (0.04)] during the observational period. Standard response means (SRMs) of UHDRS-IV (0.473-0.707) and EQ-5D VAS (0.053-0.184) were lower than that of SARA (0.404-0.979). In SCA1, higher SARA scores [- 0.0288 (0.01), p = 0.0251], longer repeat expansions [- 0.0622 (0.02), p = 0.0002] and the presence of cognitive impairment at baseline [- 0.5381 (0.25), p = 0.0365] were associated with faster UHDRS-IV decline. In SCA3, higher INAS counts were associated with a faster UHDRS-IV decline [- 0.05 (0.02), p = 0.0212]. In SCA1, PHQ-9 progression was faster in patients with cognitive impairment [0.14 (0.07); p = 0.0396].CONCLUSIONS: In the common SCAs, PROMs give complementary information to the information provided by neurological scales. This underlines the importance of PROMs as additional outcome measures in future interventional trials.KEYWORDS: ADL; Depression; Natural history studies; Quality of life; Spinocerebellar ataxia; Trinucleotide repeat diseasesPMID: 29959555 DOI: 10.1007/s00415-018-8954-0 ShareGrant supportGrant supportEU FP6 (EUROSCA)/Sixth Framework Programme/503304/Sixth Framework Programme/GeneMove/German Ministry of Education and Research/NKFIH 119540/Hungarian Funding Agency/n° 2012-305121 \"Integrated European-omics research project for diagnosis and therapy in rare neuromuscular and neurodegenerative diseases (NEUROMICS)\"/FP7 Ideas: European Research Council/\n",

Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are integral components of the extracellular matrix and are known to influence amyloid aggregation of several proteins, including α-synuclein (α-Syn). However, the mechanism by which different GAGs and related biological polymers influence protein aggregation and the structure and intercellular spread of these aggregates remains elusive. In this study, we used three different GAGs and related charged polymers to establish their role in α-Syn aggregation and associated biological activities of these aggregates. Heparin, a representative GAG, affected α-Syn aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas biphasic α-Syn aggregation kinetics was observed in the presence of chondroitin sulfate B. Of note, as indicated by 2D NMR analysis, different GAGs uniquely modulated α-Syn aggregation owing to the diversity of their interactions with soluble α-Syn. Moreover, subtle differences in the GAG backbone structure and charge density significantly altered the properties of the resulting amyloid fibrils. Each GAG/polymer facilitated the formation of morphologically and structurally distinct α-Syn amyloids, which not only displayed variable cytotoxicity, but also exhibited altered ability to internalize into cells. Our study supports the role of GAGs as key modulators in α-Syn amyloid formation, and their distinct activities may regulate amyloidogenesis depending on the type of GAG being up- or down-regulated in vivo.KEYWORDS: Parkinson disease; alpha-synuclein (a-synuclein); amyloid; amyloidogenesis; glycosaminoglycan; neurodegenerationPMID: 29959225 DOI: 10.1074/jbc.RA118.004267 Share\n",

Clinicians must be aware of the evidence for and against the use of MM in their patients who may consider using this substance.Methods: A PubMed database search was performed using the text string: \"Cannabis\"[Mesh] OR \"Marijuana Abuse\"[Mesh] OR \"Medical Marijuana\"[Mesh] OR \"Marijuana Smoking\"[Mesh] OR \"cannabi*\" OR \"tetrahydrocannabinol.\" The search was further limited to randomized clinical trial publications in English on human subjects to identify articles regarding the therapeutic use of phytocannabinoids for psychiatric and neurologic disorders. Commercially available products (ie, dronabinol, nabilone, nabiximols) and synthetic cannabinoids were excluded from the review.Results: Publications were identified that included patients with dementia, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, schizophrenia, social anxiety disorder, depression, tobacco use disorder, and neuropathic pain.Discussion: There is great variety concerning which medical conditions are approved for treatment with MM for either palliative or therapeutic benefit, depending on the state law. It is important to keep an evidence-based approach in mind, even with substances considered to be illegal under US federal law. Clinicians must weigh risks and benefits of the use of MM in their patients and should ensure that patients have tried other treatment modalities with higher levels of evidence for use when available and appropriate.KEYWORDS: CBD; THC; cannabidiol; cannabinoids; delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol; marijuana; medical marijuana; phytocannabinoids; tetrahydrocannabinol; therapeutic uses of illicit substancesPMID: 29955495 PMCID: PMC6007658 DOI: 10.9740/mhc.2017.01.029 Share\n",

      "\t\t\t\tEnglish, FrenchContexte: Les inhibiteurs de la monoamine oxydase B (MAO-B) sont employés dans le traitement des symptômes moteurs de la maladie de Parkinson, maladie à laquelle la dépression est souvent associée et fréquemment traitée à l’aide d’inhibiteurs sélectifs de la recapture de la sérotonine (ISRS). Des sources tertiaires mettent en garde contre la combinaison d’inhibiteurs de la MAO-B et d’ISRS car elle peut mener à une augmentation des effets sérotoninergiques, dégénérant en un syndrome sérotoninergique.Objectif: Chercher à connaître le mécanisme, la signification clinique et la prise en charge de cette potentielle interaction médicamenteuse en procédant à une revue des preuves à l’appui.Sources des données: Les bases de données PubMed, MEDLINE (depuis 1946), Embase (depuis 1947), PscyINFO (depuis 1806), et International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (depuis 1970) ont été interrogées le 4 février 2017.Sélection des études et extraction des données: Des études et des observations cliniques, publiées en anglais, portant sur des aspects de la potentielle interaction entre les inhibiteurs de la MAO-B et les ISRS chez les patients atteints de la maladie de Parkinson ont été repérées par une recherche ciblant les titres et les résumés.Synthèse des données: La recherche a permis de trouver 8 études analysant la potentielle interaction entre les ISRS et deux inhibiteurs de la MAO-B : la sélégiline et la rasagiline. La plus importante d’entre elles, une étude de cohorte rétrospective sur 1504 patients atteints de la maladie de Parkinson, n’a relevé aucun cas de syndrome sérotoninergique en présence d’une prise concomitante de rasagiline et d’un ISRS. Une enquête auprès de 63 chercheurs dans le Parkinson Study Group a permis de relever 11 potentiels cas de syndrome sérotoninergique chez 4568 patients traités avec une combinaison de sélégiline et d’antidépresseurs (notamment des ISRS). De plus, 17 observations cliniques qui décrivaient un début de syndrome sérotoninergique en présence d’une prise concomitante d’un ISRS et de sélégiline ou de rasagiline ont été recensées. Suivant la réduction de la posologie ou l’interruption d’un ou des deux médicaments, les symptômes du syndrome sérotoninergique se sont graduellement résolus dans la plupart des cas, et il n’y a eu aucune mortalité.Conclusions: Selon la documentation, le syndrome sérotoninergique est rare et la combinaison d’ISRS et d’inhibiteurs de la MAO-B est bien tolérée. Ainsi, les deux types d’inhibiteurs peuvent être administrés conjointement pourvu que l’on ne dépasse pas la posologie recommandée et que la dose d’ISRS demeure dans le bas de l’intervalle thérapeutique. Parmi les ISRS, il peut être préférable d’employer le citalopram ou la sertraline.Background: Monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors are used to treat the motor symptoms of Parkinson disease. Depression is commonly associated with Parkinson disease, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often used for its management. Tertiary sources warn that the combination of MAO-B inhibitors and SSRIs can result in increased serotonergic effects, leading to serotonin syndrome.Objective: To explore the mechanism, clinical significance, and management of this potential drug interaction through a review of the supporting evidence.Data Sources: PubMed, MEDLINE (1946 forward), Embase (1947 forward), PsycINFO (1806 forward), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 forward) were searched on February 4, 2017.Study Selection and Data Extraction: Studies and case reports describing aspects of the potential interaction between MAO-B inhibitors and SSRIs in patients with Parkinson disease and published in English were identified by both title and abstract.Data Synthesis: The search identified 8 studies evaluating the potential interaction between SSRIs and the MAO-B inhibitors selegiline and rasagiline. The largest, a retrospective cohort study of 1504 patients with Parkinson disease, found no cases of serotonin syndrome with coadministration of rasagiline and an SSRI. A survey of 63 investigators in the Parkinson Study Group identified 11 potential cases of serotonin syndrome among 4568 patients treated with the combination of selegiline and antidepressants (including SSRIs). In addition, 17 case reports describing the onset of serotonin syndrome with coadministration of an SSRI and either selegiline or rasagiline were identified. Following discontinuation or dose reduction of one or both of the agents, the symptoms of serotonin syndrome gradually resolved in most cases, with none being fatal.Conclusions: According to the literature, serotonin syndrome occurs rarely, and the combination of SSRI and MAO-B inhibitor is well tolerated. Therefore, SSRIs and MAO-B inhibitors can be coadministered, provided that their recommended doses are not exceeded and the SSRI dose is kept at the lower end of the therapeutic range. Among the SSRIs, citalopram and sertraline may be preferred.KEYWORDS: Parkinson disease; drug interactions; rasagiline; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; selegiline; serotonin syndromePMID: 29955193 PMCID: PMC6019085 [Available on 2018-11-01] ShareConflict of interest statementCompeting interests: This manuscript was undertaken when Abdullah Aboukarr was a fourth-year PharmD student with a placement at the Ottawa Valley Regional Drug Information Service, for which Mirella Giudice was the preceptor.

Our aim was to compare the diagnostic value of MR imaging biomarkers of substantia nigra damage for distinguishing patients with Parkinson disease from healthy volunteers.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six patients and 20 healthy volunteers were prospectively included. The MR imaging protocol at 3T included 3D T2-weighted and T1-weighted neuromelanin-sensitive images, diffusion tensor images, and R2* mapping. T2* high-resolution images were also acquired at 7T to evaluate the dorsal nigral hyperintensity sign. Quantitative analysis was performed using ROIs in the substantia nigra drawn manually around the area of high signal intensity on neuromelanin-sensitive images and T2-weighted images. Visual analysis of the substantia nigra neuromelanin-sensitive signal intensity and the dorsolateral nigral hyperintensity on T2* images was performed.RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in the neuromelanin-sensitive volume and signal intensity in patients with Parkinson disease. There was also a significant decrease in fractional anisotropy and an increase in mean, axial, and radial diffusivity in the neuromelanin-sensitive substantia nigra at 3T and a decrease in substantia nigra volume on T2* images. The combination of substantia nigra volume, signal intensity, and fractional anisotropy in the neuromelanin-sensitive substantia nigra allowed excellent diagnostic accuracy (0.93). Visual assessment of both substantia nigra dorsolateral hyperintensity and neuromelanin-sensitive images had good diagnostic accuracy (0.91 and 0.86, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: The combination of neuromelanin signal and volume changes with fractional anisotropy measurements in the substantia nigra showed excellent diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, the high diagnostic accuracy of visual assessment of substantia nigra changes using dorsolateral hyperintensity analysis or neuromelanin-sensitive signal changes indicates that these techniques are promising for clinical practice.© 2018 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.PMID: 29954816 DOI: 10.3174/ajnr.A5702 Share\n",

At baseline and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, all patients stopped all PD therapy for 1 week (medication and stimulation, if applicable). UPDRS-III \"off\" item scores were compared between the ODT and DBS + ODT groups (n = 28); items with significant between-group differences were analyzed further.RESULTS: UPDRS-III \"off\" rest tremor score change from baseline to 24 months was worse in patients receiving ODT vs DBS + ODT (p = 0.002). Rest tremor slopes from baseline to 24 months favored DBS + ODT both \"off\" and \"on\" therapy (p < 0.001, p = 0.003, respectively). More ODT patients developed new rest tremor in previously unaffected limbs than those receiving DBS + ODT (p = 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the possibility that DBS in early PD may slow rest tremor progression. Future investigation in a larger cohort is needed, and these findings will be tested in the Food and Drug Administration-approved, phase III, pivotal, multicenter clinical trial evaluating DBS in early PD.CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that for patients with early PD, DBS may slow the progression of rest tremor.© 2018 American Academy of Neurology.PMID: 29959266 DOI: 10.1212/WNL.0000000000005903 Share\n",

Linguistic analysis, focused on pauses in speech, may yield markers of impairment of cognition and communication in PD. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship of linguistic markers in semistructured speech to WFD symptoms and cognitive function in PD.Method: Speech recordings of description of the Cookie Theft picture in 53 patients with PD without dementia and 23 elderly controls were analyzed with Praat software. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA; Nasreddine et al., 2005), category naming fluency, and confrontation naming tests were administered. Questionnaires rating WFD symptoms and cognitive instrumental activities of daily living were completed. We determined the relationships between (a) pause length and location, (b) MoCA score, and (c) WFD symptoms, using Pearson's correlations and multivariate regression models.Results: Compared with controls, patients with PD had more pauses within utterances as well as fewer words per minute and a lower percentage of well-formed sentences. Pauses within utterances differed significantly between PD-mild cognitive impairment and normal cognition (p < .001). Words per minute and percentage of well-formed sentences were predictive of MoCA in multivariate regression models. Pauses before verbs were associated with patient-reported severity of WFD symptoms (p = .006).Conclusions: Linguistic markers including pauses within utterances distinguish patients with PD with mild cognitive symptoms from elderly controls. These markers are associated with global cognitive function before the onset of dementia. Pauses before verbs and grammatical markers may index early cognitive symptoms such as WFD that may interfere with functional communication.Supplemental Material: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.6615401.PMID: 29955824 DOI: 10.1044/2018_JSLHR-L-17-0304 Share\n",

Bearing in mind that standard treatments are ineffective in delaying the disease progression, alternative treatments capable of eliminating symptoms and reversing the clinical condition have been sought. Possible alternative treatments include cell therapy, especially with the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC).REVIEW SUMMARY: MSC are adult stem cells which have demonstrated remarkable therapeutic power in parkinsonian animals due to their differentiation competence, migratory capacity and the production of bioactive molecules. This review aims to analyze the main studies involving MSC and PD in more than a decade of studies, addressing their different methodologies and common characteristics, as well as suggesting perspectives on the application of MSC in PD.CONCLUSIONS: The results of MSC therapy in animal models and some clinical trials suggest that such cellular therapy may slow the progression of PD and promote neuroregeneration. However, further research is needed to address the limitations of an eventual clinical application.PMID: 29953040 DOI: 10.1097/NRL.0000000000000188 ShareLinkOut - more resourcesFull Text SourcesWolters Kluwer\n",

Thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) is a redox protein and protects neurons from various injuries. Our previous study has shown that Trx-1 overexpression attenuates movement disorder in PD. However, whether Trx-1 ameliorates cognitive deficits in PD is still unknown. In the present study, we investigated the effects of Trx-1 on learning and memory in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD model in mice. We demonstrated that deficits in learning and memory were induced by MPTP in mice through the elevated plus-maze test. We found that the retention transfer latency time was shorten, escape latency was decreased and the number of platform crossings was increased in the Morris water maze (MWM) in Trx-1 transgenic (TG) mice when compared with wild type mice. The expressions of tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) and dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) were decreased by MPTP, which were restored in Trx-1 TG mice. The expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2B subunit (NR2B), the levels of phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) in the hippocampus were decreased by MPTP, which were reversed in Trx-1 TG mice. These results suggest that Trx-1 ameliorates learning and memory deficits in MPTP-induced PD model in mice via modulating the D1R and the NMDAR-ERK1/2-CREB pathway. Trx-1 may be a therapy target for learning and memory deficits in PD.KEYWORDS: Hippocampus; Learning and memory deficits; Parkinson's disease; Thioredoxin-1PMID: 29960099 DOI: 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2018.06.029 Share\", \"Exp Neurol. 2018 Jun 27. pii: S0014-4886(18)30206-1. doi: 10.1016/j.expneurol.2018.06.016.

It still remains unclear whether MANF can rescue dopaminergic (DA) neurons in an α-synuclein model. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and its related neurturin (NRTN) can protect DA neurons in the neurotoxin but not α-synuclein animal models of PD, it failed in the clinical trials. Since α-synuclein model can better mimic the progression of human PD, in our study we overexpressed MANF specifically in DA neurons by using an α-synuclein Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) model. Our results showed MANF alleviated progressive neuronal degeneration and prevented locomotion defects. Indeed, MANF can protect cilia of DA neurons at an early stage, suggested that MANF participated in the whole process of neuronal degeneration. Furthermore, we found MANF facilitated the removal of misfolded α-synuclein proteins and rescued the function of damaged DA neurons. By using RNAi approach, we inhibited ER stress and autophagy related genes and MANF effects were decreased, which demonstrated ER stress and autophagy pathways were involved in the MANF-mediated neuroprotection. Our study suggests MANF exhibits potential as a neuroprotective agent for PD therapy.KEYWORDS: Autophagy; C. elegans; Calcium; ER stress; MANF; Neuroprotection; Parkinson's disease; α-synucleinPMID: 29959908 DOI: 10.1016/j.expneurol.2018.06.016 Share\", \"Neurology. 2018 Jun 29. pii: 10.1212/WNL.0000000000005917. doi: 10.1212/WNL.0000000000005917.

Rank orders were reassessed at 2 times after DBS. Changes in rank order over time were examined with χ2 analyses. The relationships between change in symptom severity/limits to behavioral goal attainment and change in rank order were examined with mixed-effects linear regression models.RESULTS: Most participants changed the rank order of their symptom (81%) and behavioral (77%) goals 3 months after DBS surgery. Change in rank order of symptom goals was significantly related to change in severity ratings such that improvements in self-reported symptom severity were associated with reductions in rank. In contrast, no such relationship was evident for the behavioral goals.CONCLUSION: These data illustrate how patients' primary goals for DBS shift early in stimulation and highlight the important differences between symptom and behavioral goals. Changes in the rank order of symptom goals were related to changes in symptom severity, whereas subtler shifts in behavioral goals were unrelated to improvements after DBS. This observation suggests that DBS does not affect goals that may be more reflective of core personal values. The findings provide empiric data that can help improve the informed consent process.© 2018 American Academy of Neurology.PMID: 29959262 DOI: 10.1212/WNL.0000000000005917 Share\", \"Ment Health Clin. 2018 Mar 23;7(2):65-68. doi: 10.9740/mhc.2017.03.065. eCollection  2017 Mar.Drug-induced parkinsonism: A case report.Morabito BD1, Paulison B2.Author information1Clinical Pharmacy Specialist, North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System, Gainesville, Florida, Brianna.Morabito@va.gov.2Clinical Pharmacy Specialist, North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System, Gainesville, Florida.AbstractDrug-induced parkinsonism is defined as the appearance of parkinsonism on treatment with pharmaceutical agents. Symptoms typically manifest within a few days, and 90% of cases emerge within 3 months. The patient was a 68-year-old white man with a past psychiatric history significant for bipolar I versus cyclothymic disorder. The patient presented with pressured speech, flight of ideas, distractibility, delusions, and disorganized thinking. He was started on risperidone and, due to a subclinical response, was cross-tapered from risperidone to olanzapine, and divalproex was started. The patient was then given paliperidone 234 mg long-acting injection (LAI) and a second loading dose of 156 mg 1 week later. The patient's cognitive and functional status subsequently declined, all neuroleptics were discontinued, and he was diagnosed with drug-induced parkinsonism. After a complicated hospital course the patient died approximately 5 months after the administration of paliperidone LAI. Although there are several confounding factors, due to the temporal relationship of events it is likely that paliperidone LAI was a contributing factor for the development of severe parkinsonism. Practitioners should be cognizant of the potential long-term consequences of paliperidone LAI.KEYWORDS: Invega Sustenna®; Parkinson disease; antipsychotic; divalproex; drug-induced parkinsonism; long-acting injection; paliperidone; parkinsonismPMID: 29955500 PMCID: PMC6007667 DOI: 10.9740/mhc.2017.03.065 Share\", 'Ment Health Clin. 2018 Apr 26;8(3):159-162. doi: 10.9740/mhc.2018.05.159. eCollection  2018 May.Implementation and evaluation of Parkinson disease management in an outpatient clinical pharmacist-run neurology telephone clinic.Stefan TC1, Elharar N2, Garcia G3.Author information1PGY-2 Psychiatric Pharmacy Resident, West Palm Beach Veterans Affairs Medical Center, West Palm Beach, Florida, Teodora.Stefan@va.gov.2Clinical Pharmacy Specialist - PTSD and Substance Abuse, PGY2 Psychiatry Residency Associate Director, West Palm Beach Veterans Affairs Medical Center, West Palm Beach, Florida.3Clinical Pharmacy Specialist, Psychiatry, Residency Director, PGY-2 Psychiatric Pharmacy, West Palm Beach Veterans Affairs Medical Center, West Palm Beach, Florida.AbstractParkinson disease (PD) is a progressive, debilitating neurodegenerative disease that often requires complex pharmacologic treatment regimens. Prior to this clinic, there was no involvement of a clinical pharmacy specialist (CPS) in the outpatient neurology clinic at the West Palm Beach Veterans Affairs Medical Center. This was a prospective, quality-improvement project to develop a clinical pharmacist-run neurology telephone clinic and evaluate pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions in an effort to improve the quality of care for patients with PD. Additionally, the CPS conducted medication education groups to 24 patients with PD and their caregivers, if applicable, at this medical center with the purpose of promoting patient knowledge and medication awareness. Medication management was performed via telephone rather than face to face. Only patients with a concomitant mental health diagnosis for which they were receiving at least one psychotropic medication were included for individual visits due to the established scope of practice of the CPS being limited to mental health and primary care medications. Data collection included patient and clinic demographics as well as pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions made for patients enrolled from January 6, 2017, through March 31, 2017. A total of 49 pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions were made for 10 patients. We successfully implemented and evaluated a clinical pharmacist-run neurology telephone clinic for patients with PD. Expansion of this clinic to patients with various neurological disorders may improve access to care using an innovative method of medication management expertise by a CPS.KEYWORDS: Parkinson disease; clinical pharmacist–run neurology telephone clinic; clinical pharmacy specialist; mental healthPMID: 29955562 PMCID: PMC6007640 DOI: 10.9740/mhc.2018.05.159 ShareConflict of interest statementDisclosures: The authors have nothing to disclose.', \"Ment Health Clin. 2018 Mar 23;7(6):262-270. doi: 10.9740/mhc.2017.11.262. eCollection  2017 Nov.Treatment of psychotic symptoms in patients with Parkinson disease.Chen JJ1.Author information1Professor and Chair, Department of Pharmacy Practice, College of Pharmacy, Marshall B. Ketchum University, Fullerton, California; Professor, Department of Neurology, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, California, jchen@ketchum.edu.AbstractPersistent psychotic symptoms will develop in up to 60% of patients with Parkinson disease (PD). The initial approach to the management of PD psychosis (PDP) begins with addressing concurrent systemic conditions associated with psychotic behavior, such as delirium, medical conditions (eg, infections), psychiatric disorders (eg, major depression with psychotic symptoms, mania, schizophrenia), and substance misuse or withdrawal. A review of current medications is recommended, and medications that may trigger psychotic symptoms should be eliminated. If possible, antiparkinson medications should be reduced to the minimum therapeutic dose or discontinued in a sequential manner. Generally, dose reduction or discontinuation of anticholinergics is attempted first, followed by that of monoamine oxidase B inhibitors, amantadine, dopamine agonists, catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors, and lastly carbidopa/levodopa. The aim of antiparkinson medication dose reduction is to achieve a balance between improving drug-related psychotic symptoms and not significantly worsening the motor symptoms of PD. If additional measures are needed for chronic PDP treatment, the use of second-generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine, pimavanserin, or quetiapine, must be considered. The first-generation antipsychotics (eg, fluphenazine, haloperidol) are not recommended. In the patient with comorbid dementia, the addition of a cholinesterase inhibitor might also be beneficial for PDP. The choice of agent is based on patient-specific parameters, potential benefit, and side effects.KEYWORDS: Parkinson disease; antipsychotics; clozapine; movement disorders; nonmotor symptoms; pimavanserin; psychosis; quetiapinePMID: 29955532 PMCID: PMC6007727 DOI: 10.9740/mhc.2017.11.262 ShareConflict of interest statementDisclosures: J.J.C. is on the Speaker's Bureau for ACADIA Pharmaceuticals.

There is limited research on the lived experience of hallucinations among affected individuals and therefore a lack of evidence-based management strategies. This study used qualitative methods to explore the VH experience of individuals with dementia or Parkinson\\'s disease and their informal caregivers.METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 individuals with VHs and dementia and 11 informal caregivers, and 11 individuals with VHs and Parkinson\\'s disease and 9 informal caregivers. Interviews were analysed using an inductive thematic approach.RESULTS: Three themes emerged from the data: \"Insight and distress,\" \"Caregiver approach: challenging v reassurance,\" and \"Normality and stigma.\" Insight appeared to affect whether hallucinations were perceived as threatening and whether acceptance occurred over time. Emotional reactions and management strategies varied as insight changed with disease progression. Concerns around stigmatisation negatively influenced help-seeking and acceptance of the hallucinations.CONCLUSIONS: Degree of insight and cognitive ability appear fundamental to the lived experience of hallucinations. Irrespective of the clinical context, support in early stages should focus on raising awareness of VH, symptom disclosure, stigma reduction, and contact with others affected. In later stages, the focus shifts to informal caregiver needs and a flexible approach to reassuring those affected.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.KEYWORDS: Parkinson\\'s disease; dementia; qualitative methods; visual hallucinationsPMID: 29953689 DOI: 10.1002/gps.4929 ShareLinkOut - more resourcesFull Text SourcesWiley', \"Medicine (Baltimore). 2018 Jun;97(26):e10967. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010967.Level of uric acid and uric acid/creatinine ratios in correlation with stage of Parkinson disease.Zhong LL1, Song YQ2,3, Tian XY1, Cao H1, Ju KJ1.Author information1Department of Neurology.2Department of Radiation Oncology, The Affiliated Huaian No. 1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University.3Department of Hematology, Huai'an First People's Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Huai'an, Jiangsu, P.R.

Then, factors including age, gender, dopamine dosage, UA, and UA/Cr levels were analyzed to find the independent predictive factors of PD by logistic regression.UA and UA/Cr levels in the early and medium stage PD patients were significantly higher than in the advanced stage ones. UA and UA/Cr levels in patients with good prognosis were significantly higher than in the poor ones.UA and UA/Cr levels are negatively correlated with the stages of PD and are independent negatively predicting biological indexes of PD incidence and progression.PMID: 29952939 DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010967 Free full textShareLinkOut - more resourcesFull Text SourcesWolters Kluwer\", \"Biochim Biophys Acta. 2018 Jun 27. pii: S0925-4439(18)30224-2. doi: 10.1016/j.bbadis.2018.06.020.

Electronic address: livia.civitelli@liu.se.AbstractParkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies are characterized by accumulation of misfolded aggregates of α-synuclein (α-syn). The normal function of α-syn is still under investigation, but it has been generally linked to synaptic plasticity, neurotransmitter release and the maintenance of the synaptic pool. α-Syn localizes at synaptic terminals where it can bind to synaptic vesicles as well as to other cellular membranes. It has become clear that these interactions have an impact on both α-syn functional role and its propensity to aggregate. In this study, we investigated the aggregation process of α-syn covalently modified with 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE). HNE is a product of lipid peroxidation and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of different neurodegenerative diseases by modifying the kinetics of soluble toxic oligomers. Although HNE-modified α-syn has been reported to assemble into stable oligomers, we found that slightly acidic conditions promoted further protein aggregation. Lipid vesicles delayed the aggregation process in a concentration-dependent manner, an effect that was observed only when they were added at the beginning of the aggregation process. Co-aggregation of lipid vesicles with HNE-modified α-syn also induced cytotoxic effects on differentiated SHSY-5Y cells. Under conditions in which the aggregation process was delayed cell viability was reduced. By exploring the behavior and potential cytotoxic effects of HNE-α-syn under acidic conditions in relation to protein-lipid interactions our study gives a framework to examine a possible pathway leading from a physiological setting to the pathological outcome of PD.KEYWORDS: Aggregation kinetics; Lipids; Parkinson's disease; Toxicity; α-SynucleinPMID: 29960040 DOI: 10.1016/j.bbadis.2018.06.020 Share\", \"J Neurol Sci. 2018 Jun 21. pii: S0022-510X(18)30267-3. doi: 10.1016/j.jns.2018.06.017.

Although remission can occur in ICB, only four reports on the ratio of remission and the persistence of ICB have been published, and the associated factors with ICB remission or persistence have been little known. Therefore, we conducted a longitudinal assessment of the remission, persistence, and development of ICB and those associated factors in patients with PD.METHODS: We retrospectively investigated a PD database at Aomori Prefectural Central Hospital, Japan. One hundred and forty-eight patients with PD who could be followed up for 2\\xa0years were enrolled. ICB was assessed using the Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's disease. Motor severity (Hoehn and Yahr scale and United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale), cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination), and other clinical variables (sex, age, onset age, disease duration, olfactory dysfunction, and dyskinesia) and medications used to treat PD were assessed. Univariate analyses were performed.RESULTS: Seven patients were excluded because of the exclusion criteria, and 141 patients were analyzed. Thirty patients (21.3%) had ICB at baseline, and these patients also had significantly higher use of pergolide. The ICB remission rate was 60%, the ICB persistence ratio was 40%, and the ICB development ratio was 12.6% over 2\\xa0years. Statistically, younger age and pergolide use were associated with ICB persistence. Being male, having dyskinesia, and rotigotine, entacapone, zonisamide, and istradefylline use were associated with ICB development.CONCLUSION: This study suggests that younger age and pergolide use may be the new associated factors with ICB persistence and that entacapone, zonisamide, and istradefylline use may be associated with the development of ICB. Drug profiles and medication practices in Japan may explain the association of these factors with ICB.© 2018 The Authors.

The antipsychotic effects of this new agent are believed to occur via selective inverse agonist activity at serotonin 5-HT2a receptors.Methods: Study authors completed a literature review of 2 published randomized controlled trials of pimavanserin for the treatment of Parkinson disease psychosis. The Food and Drug Administration Briefing Document by the Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee for the review of pimavanserin dated March 29, 2016, was reviewed for additional information on 2 unpublished trials.Results: Pimavanserin has demonstrated no worsening of motor symptoms of Parkinson disease, but only 1 of 4 trials has shown consistent statistically significant improvements in psychotic symptoms compared with placebo.Discussion: Options for the treatment of Parkinson disease psychosis are limited. The selective receptor profile of pimavanserin offers advantages for tolerability. Further studies are warranted to better provide clinicians and patients with information regarding the clinical utility of this agent.KEYWORDS: Parkinson disease; Pimavanserin; psychosisPMID: 29955528 PMCID: PMC6007714 DOI: 10.9740/mhc.2017.09.230 ShareConflict of interest statementDisclosures: The authors have nothing to disclose in terms of financial conflict of interest.', 'J Neurol. 2018 Jun 29. doi: 10.1007/s00415-018-8954-0.

Severity of ataxia was assessed using the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) and neurological symptoms other than ataxia with the Inventory of Non-Ataxia Signs (INAS).RESULTS: UHDRS-IV [SCA1: -\\u20091.35 (0.12); SCA2: -\\u20091.15 (0.11); SCA3: -\\u20091.16 (0.11); SCA6: -\\u20090.99 (0.12)] and EQ-5D [SCA1: -\\u20092.88 (0.72); SCA2: -\\u20091.97 (0.49); SCA3: -\\u20092.06 (0.55); SCA6: -\\u20091.03 (0.57)] decreased linearly, whereas PHQ-9 increased [SCA1: 0.15 (0.04); SCA2: 0.09 (0.03); SCA3: 0.06 (0.04); SCA6: 0.07 (0.04)] during the observational period. Standard response means (SRMs) of UHDRS-IV (0.473-0.707) and EQ-5D VAS (0.053-0.184) were lower than that of SARA (0.404-0.979). In SCA1, higher SARA scores [-\\u20090.0288 (0.01), p\\u2009=\\u20090.0251], longer repeat expansions [-\\u20090.0622 (0.02), p\\u2009=\\u20090.0002] and the presence of cognitive impairment at baseline [-\\u20090.5381 (0.25), p\\u2009=\\u20090.0365] were associated with faster UHDRS-IV decline. In SCA3, higher INAS counts were associated with a faster UHDRS-IV decline [-\\u20090.05 (0.02), p\\u2009=\\u20090.0212]. In SCA1, PHQ-9 progression was faster in patients with cognitive impairment [0.14 (0.07); p\\u2009=\\u20090.0396].CONCLUSIONS: In the common SCAs, PROMs give complementary information to the information provided by neurological scales. This underlines the importance of PROMs as additional outcome measures in future interventional trials.KEYWORDS: ADL; Depression; Natural history studies; Quality of life; Spinocerebellar ataxia; Trinucleotide repeat diseasesPMID: 29959555 DOI: 10.1007/s00415-018-8954-0 ShareGrant supportGrant supportEU FP6 (EUROSCA)/Sixth Framework Programme/503304/Sixth Framework Programme/GeneMove/German Ministry of Education and Research/NKFIH 119540/Hungarian Funding Agency/n° 2012-305121 \"Integrated European-omics research project for diagnosis and therapy in rare neuromuscular and neurodegenerative diseases (NEUROMICS)\"/FP7 Ideas: European Research Council/', \"J Biol Chem. 2018 Jun 29. pii: jbc.RA118.004267. doi: 10.1074/jbc.RA118.004267. [Epub ahead of print]Glycosaminoglycans have variable effects on α-synuclein aggregation and differentially affect the activities of the resulting amyloid fibrils.Mehra S1, Ghosh D2, Kumar R1, Mondal M3, Gadhe LG1, Das S1, Anoop A1, Jha NN1, Jacob RS1, Chatterjee D1, Ray S1, Singh N1, Kumar A1, Maji SK1.Author information1IIT Bombay, India.2BSBE, IIT Bombay, India.3IIT Bombay.AbstractParkinson's disease is a sporadic disorder in which both environmental and cellular factors play a major role in the initiation of this disease. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are integral components of the extracellular matrix and are known to influence amyloid aggregation of several proteins, including α-synuclein (α-Syn). However, the mechanism by which different GAGs and related biological polymers influence protein aggregation and the structure and intercellular spread of these aggregates remains elusive. In this study, we used three different GAGs and related charged polymers to establish their role in α-Syn aggregation and associated biological activities of these aggregates. Heparin, a representative GAG, affected α-Syn aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas biphasic α-Syn aggregation kinetics was observed in the presence of chondroitin sulfate B. Of note, as indicated by 2D NMR analysis, different GAGs uniquely modulated α-Syn aggregation owing to the diversity of their interactions with soluble α-Syn. Moreover, subtle differences in the GAG backbone structure and charge density significantly altered the properties of the resulting amyloid fibrils. Each GAG/polymer facilitated the formation of morphologically and structurally distinct α-Syn amyloids, which not only displayed variable cytotoxicity, but also exhibited altered ability to internalize into cells. Our study supports the role of GAGs as key modulators in α-Syn amyloid formation, and their distinct activities may regulate amyloidogenesis depending on the type of GAG being up- or down-regulated in vivo.KEYWORDS: Parkinson disease; alpha-synuclein (a-synuclein); amyloid; amyloidogenesis; glycosaminoglycan; neurodegenerationPMID: 29959225 DOI: 10.1074/jbc.RA118.004267 Share\", 'Ment Health Clin. 2018 Mar 23;7(1):29-38. doi: 10.9740/mhc.2017.01.029. eCollection  2017 Jan.Evidence for the use of \"medical marijuana\" in psychiatric and neurologic disorders.Noel C1.Author information1Assistant Professor of Pharmacy Practice, St John Fisher College Wegman\\'s School of Pharmacy, Rochester, New York; Clinical Pharmacist, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York, cnoel@sjfc.edu.AbstractIntroduction: Cannabis is listed as a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, meaning the US federal government defines it as an illegal drug that has high potential for abuse and no established medical use; however, half of the states in the nation have enacted \"medical marijuana\" (MM) laws. Clinicians must be aware of the evidence for and against the use of MM in their patients who may consider using this substance.Methods: A PubMed database search was performed using the text string: \"Cannabis\"[Mesh] OR \"Marijuana Abuse\"[Mesh] OR \"Medical Marijuana\"[Mesh] OR \"Marijuana Smoking\"[Mesh] OR \"cannabi*\" OR \"tetrahydrocannabinol.\" The search was further limited to randomized clinical trial publications in English on human subjects to identify articles regarding the therapeutic use of phytocannabinoids for psychiatric and neurologic disorders. Commercially available products (ie, dronabinol, nabilone, nabiximols) and synthetic cannabinoids were excluded from the review.Results: Publications were identified that included patients with dementia, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, schizophrenia, social anxiety disorder, depression, tobacco use disorder, and neuropathic pain.Discussion: There is great variety concerning which medical conditions are approved for treatment with MM for either palliative or therapeutic benefit, depending on the state law. It is important to keep an evidence-based approach in mind, even with substances considered to be illegal under US federal law. Clinicians must weigh risks and benefits of the use of MM in their patients and should ensure that patients have tried other treatment modalities with higher levels of evidence for use when available and appropriate.KEYWORDS: CBD; THC; cannabidiol; cannabinoids; delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol; marijuana; medical marijuana; phytocannabinoids; tetrahydrocannabinol; therapeutic uses of illicit substancesPMID: 29955495 PMCID: PMC6007658 DOI: 10.9740/mhc.2017.01.029 Share', 'Can J Hosp Pharm. 2018 May-Jun;71(3):196-207.

Des sources tertiaires mettent en garde contre la combinaison d’inhibiteurs de la MAO-B et d’ISRS car elle peut mener à une augmentation des effets sérotoninergiques, dégénérant en un syndrome sérotoninergique.Objectif: Chercher à connaître le mécanisme, la signification clinique et la prise en charge de cette potentielle interaction médicamenteuse en procédant à une revue des preuves à l’appui.Sources des données: Les bases de données PubMed, MEDLINE (depuis 1946), Embase (depuis 1947), PscyINFO (depuis 1806), et International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (depuis 1970) ont été interrogées le 4 février 2017.Sélection des études et extraction des données: Des études et des observations cliniques, publiées en anglais, portant sur des aspects de la potentielle interaction entre les inhibiteurs de la MAO-B et les ISRS chez les patients atteints de la maladie de Parkinson ont été repérées par une recherche ciblant les titres et les résumés.Synthèse des données: La recherche a permis de trouver 8 études analysant la potentielle interaction entre les ISRS et deux inhibiteurs de la MAO-B : la sélégiline et la rasagiline. La plus importante d’entre elles, une étude de cohorte rétrospective sur 1504 patients atteints de la maladie de Parkinson, n’a relevé aucun cas de syndrome sérotoninergique en présence d’une prise concomitante de rasagiline et d’un ISRS. Une enquête auprès de 63 chercheurs dans le Parkinson Study Group a permis de relever 11 potentiels cas de syndrome sérotoninergique chez 4568 patients traités avec une combinaison de sélégiline et d’antidépresseurs (notamment des ISRS). De plus, 17 observations cliniques qui décrivaient un début de syndrome sérotoninergique en présence d’une prise concomitante d’un ISRS et de sélégiline ou de rasagiline ont été recensées. Suivant la réduction de la posologie ou l’interruption d’un ou des deux médicaments, les symptômes du syndrome sérotoninergique se sont graduellement résolus dans la plupart des cas, et il n’y a eu aucune mortalité.Conclusions: Selon la documentation, le syndrome sérotoninergique est rare et la combinaison d’ISRS et d’inhibiteurs de la MAO-B est bien tolérée. Ainsi, les deux types d’inhibiteurs peuvent être administrés conjointement pourvu que l’on ne dépasse pas la posologie recommandée et que la dose d’ISRS demeure dans le bas de l’intervalle thérapeutique. Parmi les ISRS, il peut être préférable d’employer le citalopram ou la sertraline.Background: Monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors are used to treat the motor symptoms of Parkinson disease. Depression is commonly associated with Parkinson disease, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often used for its management. Tertiary sources warn that the combination of MAO-B inhibitors and SSRIs can result in increased serotonergic effects, leading to serotonin syndrome.Objective: To explore the mechanism, clinical significance, and management of this potential drug interaction through a review of the supporting evidence.Data Sources: PubMed, MEDLINE (1946 forward), Embase (1947 forward), PsycINFO (1806 forward), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 forward) were searched on February 4, 2017.Study Selection and Data Extraction: Studies and case reports describing aspects of the potential interaction between MAO-B inhibitors and SSRIs in patients with Parkinson disease and published in English were identified by both title and abstract.Data Synthesis: The search identified 8 studies evaluating the potential interaction between SSRIs and the MAO-B inhibitors selegiline and rasagiline. The largest, a retrospective cohort study of 1504 patients with Parkinson disease, found no cases of serotonin syndrome with coadministration of rasagiline and an SSRI. A survey of 63 investigators in the Parkinson Study Group identified 11 potential cases of serotonin syndrome among 4568 patients treated with the combination of selegiline and antidepressants (including SSRIs). In addition, 17 case reports describing the onset of serotonin syndrome with coadministration of an SSRI and either selegiline or rasagiline were identified. Following discontinuation or dose reduction of one or both of the agents, the symptoms of serotonin syndrome gradually resolved in most cases, with none being fatal.Conclusions: According to the literature, serotonin syndrome occurs rarely, and the combination of SSRI and MAO-B inhibitor is well tolerated. Therefore, SSRIs and MAO-B inhibitors can be coadministered, provided that their recommended doses are not exceeded and the SSRI dose is kept at the lower end of the therapeutic range. Among the SSRIs, citalopram and sertraline may be preferred.KEYWORDS: Parkinson disease; drug interactions; rasagiline; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; selegiline; serotonin syndromePMID: 29955193 PMCID: PMC6019085 [Available on 2018-11-01] ShareConflict of interest statementCompeting interests: This manuscript was undertaken when Abdullah Aboukarr was a fourth-year PharmD student with a placement at the Ottawa Valley Regional Drug Information Service, for which Mirella Giudice was the preceptor.

Our aim was to compare the diagnostic value of MR imaging biomarkers of substantia nigra damage for distinguishing patients with Parkinson disease from healthy volunteers.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six patients and 20 healthy volunteers were prospectively included. The MR imaging protocol at 3T included 3D T2-weighted and T1-weighted neuromelanin-sensitive images, diffusion tensor images, and R2* mapping. T2* high-resolution images were also acquired at 7T to evaluate the dorsal nigral hyperintensity sign. Quantitative analysis was performed using ROIs in the substantia nigra drawn manually around the area of high signal intensity on neuromelanin-sensitive images and T2-weighted images. Visual analysis of the substantia nigra neuromelanin-sensitive signal intensity and the dorsolateral nigral hyperintensity on T2* images was performed.RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in the neuromelanin-sensitive volume and signal intensity in patients with Parkinson disease. There was also a significant decrease in fractional anisotropy and an increase in mean, axial, and radial diffusivity in the neuromelanin-sensitive substantia nigra at 3T and a decrease in substantia nigra volume on T2* images. The combination of substantia nigra volume, signal intensity, and fractional anisotropy in the neuromelanin-sensitive substantia nigra allowed excellent diagnostic accuracy (0.93). Visual assessment of both substantia nigra dorsolateral hyperintensity and neuromelanin-sensitive images had good diagnostic accuracy (0.91 and 0.86, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: The combination of neuromelanin signal and volume changes with fractional anisotropy measurements in the substantia nigra showed excellent diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, the high diagnostic accuracy of visual assessment of substantia nigra changes using dorsolateral hyperintensity analysis or neuromelanin-sensitive signal changes indicates that these techniques are promising for clinical practice.© 2018 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.PMID: 29954816 DOI: 10.3174/ajnr.A5702 Share\", 'Neurology. 2018 Jun 29. pii: 10.1212/WNL.0000000000005903. doi: 10.1212/WNL.0000000000005903.

At baseline and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, all patients stopped all PD therapy for 1 week (medication and stimulation, if applicable). UPDRS-III \"off\" item scores were compared between the ODT and DBS + ODT groups (n = 28); items with significant between-group differences were analyzed further.RESULTS: UPDRS-III \"off\" rest tremor score change from baseline to 24 months was worse in patients receiving ODT vs DBS + ODT (p = 0.002). Rest tremor slopes from baseline to 24 months favored DBS + ODT both \"off\" and \"on\" therapy (p < 0.001, p = 0.003, respectively). More ODT patients developed new rest tremor in previously unaffected limbs than those receiving DBS + ODT (p = 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the possibility that DBS in early PD may slow rest tremor progression. Future investigation in a larger cohort is needed, and these findings will be tested in the Food and Drug Administration-approved, phase III, pivotal, multicenter clinical trial evaluating DBS in early PD.CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that for patients with early PD, DBS may slow the progression of rest tremor.© 2018 American Academy of Neurology.PMID: 29959266 DOI: 10.1212/WNL.0000000000005903 Share', \"J Speech Lang Hear Res. 2018 Jun 28:1-9. doi: 10.1044/2018_JSLHR-L-17-0304.

Linguistic analysis, focused on pauses in speech, may yield markers of impairment of cognition and communication in PD. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship of linguistic markers in semistructured speech to WFD symptoms and cognitive function in PD.Method: Speech recordings of description of the Cookie Theft picture in 53 patients with PD without dementia and 23 elderly controls were analyzed with Praat software. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA; Nasreddine et al., 2005), category naming fluency, and confrontation naming tests were administered. Questionnaires rating WFD symptoms and cognitive instrumental activities of daily living were completed. We determined the relationships between (a) pause length and location, (b) MoCA score, and (c) WFD symptoms, using Pearson's correlations and multivariate regression models.Results: Compared with controls, patients with PD had more pauses within utterances as well as fewer words per minute and a lower percentage of well-formed sentences. Pauses within utterances differed significantly between PD-mild cognitive impairment and normal cognition (p < .001). Words per minute and percentage of well-formed sentences were predictive of MoCA in multivariate regression models. Pauses before verbs were associated with patient-reported severity of WFD symptoms (p = .006).Conclusions: Linguistic markers including pauses within utterances distinguish patients with PD with mild cognitive symptoms from elderly controls. These markers are associated with global cognitive function before the onset of dementia. Pauses before verbs and grammatical markers may index early cognitive symptoms such as WFD that may interfere with functional communication.Supplemental Material: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.6615401.PMID: 29955824 DOI: 10.1044/2018_JSLHR-L-17-0304 Share\", 'Neurologist. 2018 Jul;23(4):141-147. doi: 10.1097/NRL.0000000000000188.Therapy With Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Parkinson Disease: History and Perspectives.Mendes Filho D1,2, Ribeiro PDC2,3, Oliveira LF1,4, de Paula DRM1, Capuano V1, de Assunção TSF5,6, da Silva VJD1,5.Author information1Departments of Physiology, Biological and Natural Sciences Institute.2Nanocell Institute, Divinópolis, MG.3Laboratory of Immunology and Experimental Transplantation, São José do Rio Preto Medical School, São José do Rio Preto, SP.4National Institute of Science and Technology for Regenerative Medicine (INCT-REGENERA-CNPq), Rio de Janeiro, RJ.5Tropical Medicine and Infectiology, Health Sciences Institute, Triângulo Mineiro Federal University, Uberaba.6Minas Gerais Network for Tissue Engineering and Cell Therapy (REMETTEC-FAPEMIG), Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.AbstractBACKGROUND: Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting the basal nuclei, causing motor and cognitive disorders. Bearing in mind that standard treatments are ineffective in delaying the disease progression, alternative treatments capable of eliminating symptoms and reversing the clinical condition have been sought. Possible alternative treatments include cell therapy, especially with the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC).REVIEW SUMMARY: MSC are adult stem cells which have demonstrated remarkable therapeutic power in parkinsonian animals due to their differentiation competence, migratory capacity and the production of bioactive molecules. This review aims to analyze the main studies involving MSC and PD in more than a decade of studies, addressing their different methodologies and common characteristics, as well as suggesting perspectives on the application of MSC in PD.CONCLUSIONS: The results of MSC therapy in animal models and some clinical trials suggest that such cellular therapy may slow the progression of PD and promote neuroregeneration. However, further research is needed to address the limitations of an eventual clinical application.PMID: 29953040 DOI: 10.1097/NRL.0000000000000188 ShareLinkOut - more resourcesFull Text SourcesWolters Kluwer']]}\n"
