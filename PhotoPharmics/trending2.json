Parkin is autoinhibited, and requires activation by PINK1, which phosphorylates Ser65 in ubiquitin and in the parkin ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain. Parkin binds phospho-ubiquitin, which enables efficient parkin phosphorylation; however, the enzyme remains autoinhibited with an inaccessible active site5,6. It is unclear how phosphorylation of parkin activates the molecule. Here we follow the activation of full-length human parkin by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, and reveal large-scale domain rearrangement in the activation process, during which the phospho-Ubl rebinds to the parkin core and releases the catalytic RING2 domain. A 1.8\u00a0\u00c5 crystal structure of phosphorylated human parkin reveals the binding site of the phospho-Ubl on the unique parkin domain (UPD), involving a phosphate-binding pocket lined by AR-JP mutations. Notably, a conserved linker region between Ubl and the UPD acts as an activating element (ACT) that contributes to RING2 release by mimicking RING2 interactions on the UPD, explaining further AR-JP mutations. Our data show how autoinhibition in parkin is resolved, and suggest a mechanism for how parkin ubiquitinates its substrates via an untethered RING2 domain. These findings open new avenues for the design of parkin activators for clinical use.PMID: 29995846 DOI: 10.1038/s41586-018-0224-x ShareLinkOut - more resourcesFull Text SourcesNature Publishing GroupMiscellaneousNCI CPTC Antibody Characterization Program", "Sci Transl Med. 2018 Jul 11;10(449). pii: eaao3240. doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aao3240.CRISPR-enhanced engineering of therapy-sensitive cancer cells for self-targeting of primary and metastatic tumors.Reinshagen C1,2,3, Bhere D1,2,3, Choi SH1,2,3, Hutten S3, Nesterenko I3, Wakimoto H1,2,4, Le Roux E3, Rizvi A3, Du W3, Minicucci C3, Shah K5,2,3,6.Author information1Center for Stem Cell Therapeutics and Imaging, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.2Department of Neurosurgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.3Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114, USA.4Department of Neurosurgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114, USA.5Center for Stem Cell Therapeutics and Imaging, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA. kshah@bwh.harvard.edu.6Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.AbstractTumor cells engineered to express therapeutic agents have shown promise to treat cancer. However, their potential to target cell surface receptors specific to the tumor site and their posttreatment fate have not been explored. We created therapeutic tumor cells expressing ligands specific to primary and recurrent tumor sites (receptor self-targeted tumor cells) and extensively characterized two different approaches using (i) therapy-resistant cancer cells, engineered with secretable death receptor-targeting ligands for \"off-the-shelf\" therapy in primary tumor settings, and (ii) therapy-sensitive cancer cells, which were CRISPR-engineered to knock out therapy-specific cell surface receptors before engineering with receptor self-targeted ligands and reapplied in autologous models of recurrent or metastatic disease. We show that both approaches allow high expression of targeted ligands that induce tumor cell killing and translate into marked survival benefits in mouse models of multiple cancer types. Safe elimination of therapeutic cancer cells after treatment was achieved by co-engineering with a prodrug-converting suicide system, which also allowed for real-time in vivo positron emission tomography imaging of therapeutic tumor cell fate. This study demonstrates self-tumor tropism of engineered cancer cells and their therapeutic potential when engineered with receptor self-targeted molecules, and it establishes a roadmap toward a safe clinical translation for different cancer types in primary, recurrent, and metastatic settings.PMID: 29997250 DOI: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aao3240 ShareLinkOut - more resourcesFull Text SourcesHighWire", "Nature. 2018 Jul 11. doi: 10.1038/s41586-018-0322-9.

Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans exhibit reproductive isolation, owing in part to the fact that D. melanogaster females produce 7,11-heptacosadiene, a pheromone that promotes courtship in D. melanogaster males but suppresses courtship in D. simulans males. Here we compare pheromone-processing pathways in D. melanogaster and D. simulans males to define how these sister species endow 7,11-heptacosadiene with the opposite behavioural valence to underlie species discrimination. We show that males of both species detect 7,11-heptacosadiene using homologous peripheral sensory neurons, but this signal is differentially propagated to P1 neurons, which control courtship behaviour. A change in the balance of excitation and inhibition onto courtship-promoting neurons transforms an excitatory pheromonal cue in D. melanogaster into an inhibitory cue in D. simulans. Our results reveal how species-specific pheromone responses can emerge from conservation of peripheral detection mechanisms and diversification of central circuitry, and demonstrate how flexible nodes in neural circuits can contribute to behavioural evolution.PMID: 29995860 DOI: 10.1038/s41586-018-0322-9 ShareLinkOut - more resourcesFull Text SourcesNature Publishing Group", "Nature. 2018 Jul 11. doi: 10.1038/s41586-018-0316-7.

Depletion of tetrahydrofolate causes cell death by suppressing DNA and RNA production3. Although methotrexate is widely used as an anticancer agent and is the subject of over a thousand ongoing clinical trials4, its high toxicity often leads to the premature termination of its use, which reduces its potential efficacy5. To identify genes that modulate the response of cancer cells to methotrexate, we performed a CRISPR-Cas9-based screen6,7. This screen yielded FTCD, which encodes an enzyme-formimidoyltransferase cyclodeaminase-that is required for the catabolism of the amino acid histidine8, a process that has not\u00a0previously been linked to methotrexate sensitivity. In cultured cancer cells, depletion of several genes in the histidine degradation\u00a0pathway markedly decreased sensitivity to methotrexate. Mechanistically, histidine catabolism drains the cellular pool of tetrahydrofolate, which is particularly detrimental to methotrexate-treated cells. Moreover, expression of the rate-limiting enzyme in histidine catabolism is associated with methotrexate sensitivity in cancer cell lines and with survival rate in patients. In vivo dietary supplementation of histidine increased flux through the histidine degradation pathway and enhanced the sensitivity of leukaemia xenografts to methotrexate. The histidine degradation pathway markedly influences the sensitivity of cancer cells to methotrexate and may be exploited to improve methotrexate efficacy through a simple dietary intervention.PMID: 29995852 DOI: 10.1038/s41586-018-0316-7 ShareGrant supportGrant supportR01 CA129105/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesLinkOut - more resourcesFull Text SourcesNature Publishing Group", "N Engl J Med. 2018 Jul 12;379(2):138-149. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1714021.Prevention of M. tuberculosis Infection with H4:IC31 Vaccine or BCG Revaccination.Nemes E1, Geldenhuys H1, Rozot V1, Rutkowski KT1, Ratangee F1, Bilek N1, Mabwe S1, Makhethe L1, Erasmus M1, Toefy A1, Mulenga H1, Hanekom WA1, Self SG1, Bekker LG1, Ryall R1, Gurunathan S1, DiazGranados CA1, Andersen P1, Kromann I1, Evans T1, Ellis RD1, Landry B1, Hokey DA1, Hopkins R1, Ginsberg AM1, Scriba TJ1, Hatherill M1; C-040-404 Study Team.Author information1From the South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative, Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine and Division of Immunology, Department of Pathology (E.N., H.G., V.R., F.R., N.B., S.M., L.M., M.E., A.T., H.M., W.A.H., T.J.S., M.H.), and Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation (L.-G.B.), University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa; Aeras, Rockville, MD (K.T.R., T.E., R.D.E., B.L., D.A.H., R.H., A.M.G.); Statistical Center for HIV Research, Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle (S.G.S.); Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater, PA (R.R., S.G., C.A.D.); and Center for Vaccine Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen (P.A., I.K.).AbstractBACKGROUND: Recent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection confers a predisposition to the development of tuberculosis disease, the leading killer among global infectious diseases. H4:IC31, a candidate subunit vaccine, has shown protection against tuberculosis disease in preclinical models, and observational studies have indicated that primary bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination may offer partial protection against infection.METHODS: In this phase 2 trial, we randomly assigned 990 adolescents in a high-risk setting who had undergone neonatal BCG vaccination to receive the H4:IC31 vaccine, BCG revaccination, or placebo. All the participants had negative results on testing for M. tuberculosis infection on the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-tube assay (QFT) and for the human immunodeficiency virus. The primary outcomes were safety and acquisition of M. tuberculosis infection, as defined by initial conversion on QFT that was performed every 6 months during a 2-year period. Secondary outcomes were immunogenicity and sustained QFT conversion to a positive test without reversion to negative status at 3 months and 6 months after conversion. Estimates of vaccine efficacy are based on hazard ratios from Cox regression models and compare each vaccine with placebo.RESULTS: Both the BCG and H4:IC31 vaccines were immunogenic. QFT conversion occurred in 44 of 308 participants (14.3%) in the H4:IC31 group and in 41 of 312 participants (13.1%) in the BCG group, as compared with 49 of 310 participants (15.8%) in the placebo group; the rate of sustained conversion was 8.1% in the H4:IC31 group and 6.7% in the BCG group, as compared with 11.6% in the placebo group. Neither the H4:IC31 vaccine nor the BCG vaccine prevented initial QFT conversion, with efficacy point estimates of 9.4% (P=0.63) and 20.1% (P=0.29), respectively. However, the BCG vaccine reduced the rate of sustained QFT conversion, with an efficacy of 45.4% (P=0.03); the efficacy of the H4:IC31 vaccine was 30.5% (P=0.16). There were no clinically significant between-group differences in the rates of serious adverse events, although mild-to-moderate injection-site reactions were more common with BCG revaccination.CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, the rate of sustained QFT conversion, which may reflect sustained M. tuberculosis infection, was reduced by vaccination in a high-transmission setting. This finding may inform clinical development of new vaccine candidates.

Each participant followed a schedule of evaluations according to study arm and QFT test results. An 84-day wash-out period was implemented to account for participants who may already have been M.tb-infected at enrollment but had not yet QFT converted. After the primary analysis, the IDMC recommended that participants who converted at Month 6 or 12 should return for an additional end-of-study visit to evaluate sustained QFT conversion.

Here, we present a 52,698-cell catalog of the TME transcriptome in human lung tumors at single-cell resolution, validated in independent samples where 40,250 additional cells were sequenced. By comparing with matching non-malignant lung samples, we reveal a highly complex TME that profoundly molds stromal cells. We identify 52 stromal cell subtypes, including novel subpopulations in cell types hitherto considered to be homogeneous, as well as transcription factors underlying their heterogeneity. For instance, we discover fibroblasts expressing different collagen sets, endothelial cells downregulating immune cell homing and genes coregulated with established immune checkpoint transcripts and correlating with T-cell activity. By assessing marker genes for these cell subtypes in bulk RNA-sequencing data from 1,572 patients, we illustrate how these correlate with survival, while immunohistochemistry for selected markers validates them as separate cellular entities in an independent series of lung tumors. Hence, in providing a comprehensive catalog of stromal cells types and by characterizing their phenotype and co-optive behavior, this resource provides deeper insights into lung cancer biology that will be helpful in advancing lung cancer diagnosis and therapy.PMID: 29988129 DOI: 10.1038/s41591-018-0096-5 ShareLinkOut - more resourcesFull Text SourcesNature Publishing Group", "Nature. 2018 Jul 9. doi: 10.1038/s41586-018-0317-6.

Most cases arise without any detectable early symptoms and patients usually present with the acute complications of bone marrow failure1. The onset of such de novo AML cases is typically preceded by the accumulation of somatic mutations in preleukaemic haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) that undergo clonal expansion2,3. However, recurrent AML mutations also accumulate in HSPCs during ageing of healthy individuals who do not develop AML, a phenomenon referred to as age-related clonal haematopoiesis (ARCH)4-8. Here we use deep sequencing to analyse genes that are recurrently mutated in AML to distinguish between individuals who have a high risk of developing AML and those with benign ARCH. We analysed peripheral blood cells from 95 individuals that were obtained on average 6.3\u00a0years before AML diagnosis (pre-AML group), together with 414 unselected age- and gender-matched individuals (control group). Pre-AML cases were distinct from controls and had more mutations per sample, higher variant allele frequencies, indicating greater clonal expansion, and showed enrichment of mutations in specific genes. Genetic parameters were used to derive a model that accurately predicted AML-free survival; this model was validated in an independent cohort of 29 pre-AML cases and 262 controls. Because AML is rare, we also developed an AML predictive model using a large electronic health record database that identified individuals at greater risk. Collectively our findings provide proof-of-concept that it is possible to discriminate ARCH from pre-AML many years before malignant transformation. This could in future enable earlier detection and monitoring, and may help to inform intervention.PMID: 29988082 DOI: 10.1038/s41586-018-0317-6 ShareLinkOut - more resourcesFull Text SourcesNature Publishing Group", "Cell Rep. 2018 Jul 10;24(2):429-440. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2018.06.042.NAD+ Depletion Triggers Macrophage Necroptosis, a Cell Death Pathway Exploited by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Pajuelo D1, Gonzalez-Juarbe N1, Tak U1, Sun J1, Orihuela CJ1, Niederweis M2.Author information1Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.2Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA. Electronic address: mnieder@uab.edu.AbstractMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) kills infected macrophages by inhibiting apoptosis and promoting necrosis. The tuberculosis necrotizing toxin (TNT) is a secreted nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) glycohydrolase that induces necrosis in infected macrophages. Here, we show that NAD+ depletion by TNT activates RIPK3 and MLKL, key mediators of necroptosis. Notably, Mtb bypasses the canonical necroptosis pathway since neither TNF-\u03b1 nor RIPK1 are required for macrophage death. Macrophage necroptosis is associated with depolarized mitochondria and impaired ATP synthesis, known hallmarks of Mtb-induced cell death. These results identify TNT as the main trigger of necroptosis in\u00a0Mtb-infected macrophages. Surprisingly, NAD+ depletion itself was sufficient to trigger necroptosis in a RIPK3- and MLKL-dependent manner by inhibiting the NAD+ salvage pathway in THP-1 cells or by TNT expression in Jurkat T\u00a0cells. These findings suggest avenues for host-directed therapies to treat tuberculosis and other infectious and age-related diseases in which NAD+ deficiency is a pathological factor.KEYWORDS: MLKL; NAD(+); RIPK3; TNT; cell death; mitochondria; necroptosis; toxin; tuberculosisPMID: 29996103 DOI: 10.1016/j.celrep.2018.06.042 ShareLinkOut - more resourcesMiscellaneousNCI CPTAC Assay PortalNCI CPTAC Assay PortalNCI CPTAC Assay Portal"]}
