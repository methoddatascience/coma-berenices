In mammalian cells, DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are responsible for modifying cytosine to 5-methylcytosine (5mC), which can be further oxidized by the TET dioxygenases to ultimately cause DNA demethylation. However, the genome-wide cooperation and functions of these two families of proteins, especially at large under-methylated regions, called canyons, remain largely unknown.RESULTS: Here we demonstrate that DNMT3A and TET1 function in a complementary and competitive manner in mouse embryonic stem cells to mediate proper epigenetic landscapes and gene expression. The longer isoform of DNMT3A, DNMT3A1, exhibits significant enrichment at distal promoters and canyon edges, but is excluded from proximal promoters and canyons where TET1 shows prominent binding. Deletion of Tet1 increases DNMT3A1 binding capacity at and around genes with wild-type TET1 binding. However, deletion of Dnmt3a has a minor effect on TET1 binding on chromatin, indicating that TET1 may limit DNA methylation partially by protecting its targets from DNMT3A and establishing boundaries for DNA methylation. Local CpG density may determine their complementary binding patterns and therefore that the methylation landscape is encoded in the DNA sequence. Furthermore, DNMT3A and TET1 impact histone modifications which in turn regulate gene expression. In particular, they regulate Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated H3K27me3 enrichment to constrain gene expression from bivalent promoters.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that DNMT3A and TET1 regulate the epigenome and gene expression at specific targets via their functional interplay.KEYWORDS: DNA methylation; DNMT3A; Embryonic stem cells; H3K27me3; PRC2; TET1PMID: 30001199 PMCID: PMC6042404 DOI: 10.1186/s13059-018-1464-7 Free PMC ArticleShareImages from this publication.See all images  (7)Free textFig. 1Global DNA methylation in mouse ESCs is predominantly regulated by DNMT3A. a Average genome-wide methylated CpG dinucleotides percentages in WT, Dnmt3a KO, and Dnmt3b KO ESCs. b Violin plots of CpG methylation levels in WT, Dnmt3a KO, and Dnmt3b KO ESCs determined by whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) at the indicated genomic features. c UCSC genome browser track depicting DNA methylation at the Sox2 locus in WT, Dnmt3a KO, and Dnmt3b KO ESCs.

We sought to identify the toxins being sold as mothballs in Greater Accra and use this information to help educate both clinicians and the public.METHODS: Mothballs are commonly sold by street and marketplace vendors in unmarked cling film-wrapped packs. Fifteen small packs of mothballs were purchased from random vendors in three major markets and six roadside stands in Greater Accra. All samples were subjected to the float test; one sample was confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy.RESULTS: All samples sank in tap water but floated in a saturated salt solution, consistent with naphthalene. The analysed sample was identified as naphthalene.CONCLUSION: Naphthalene was most likely the primary ingredient in all the mothballs purchased for the study. Naphthalene is poorly soluble in water, and 'camphor water' is unlikely to cause harm. However, ideas about the efficacy of 'camphor' as a purification tool may lead to therapeutic misuse by analogy. A high prevalence of G6PD in the Ghanaian population may increase the risk of toxic haematologic effects from ingestion of mothballs. Mothballs known in Greater Accra as 'camphor' are likely to be predominantly naphthalene. A public awareness campaign about the health risks of mothball ingestion is planned.\u00a9 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.PMID: 21967193 DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2011.02885.x  [Indexed for MEDLINE] Free full textShareMeSH terms, SubstancesMeSH termsAnimalsCamphorCommerceGhanaGlucosephosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency/complicationsHazardous Substances/adverse effects*Hazardous Substances/analysisHumansInsect Repellents/adverse effects*Insect Repellents/analysisMoths*Naphthalenes/adverse effects*Naphthalenes/analysisPublic Health*SolubilityWaterSubstancesHazardous SubstancesInsect RepellentsNaphthalenesWaternaphthaleneCamphorLinkOut - more resourcesFull Text SourcesWileyOvid Technologies, Inc.MiscellaneousCAMPHOR - Hazardous Substances Data BankNAPHTHALENE - Hazardous Substances Data BankWater - Hazardous Substances Data BankNCI CPTAC Assay PortalNCI CPTAC Assay Portal", "Nat Med. 2018 Jul 9. doi: 10.1038/s41591-018-0133-4.

Severely deficient activity of the protease can trigger an acute episode of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Our understanding of the pathophysiology of TTP, has allowed us to grasp the important role of ADAMTS13 in other thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) and thrombotic disorders, such as ischemic stroke and coronary artery disease. Through its action on von willebrand factor (VWF), ADAMTS13 can have prothrombotic and proinflammatory properties, not only when its activity is severely deficient but also when it is only moderately low. Here, we will discuss the biology of ADAMTS13 and the different assays developed to evaluate its function in the context of TTP, in the acute setting and during follow up. We will also discuss the latest evidence on the role of ADAMTS13 on other TMA, stroke and cardiovascular disease. This information will be useful for clinicians when evaluating a patient that presents with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, but also when making clinical decision regarding the follow up of patients with TTP.PMID: 30006329 DOI: 10.1182/blood-2018-02-791533 ShareLinkOut - more resourcesFull Text SourcesHighWire - PDF", "Nature. 2018 Jul 11. doi: 10.1038/s41586-018-0326-5.

The need for viral vectors has slowed down research and clinical use as their manufacturing and testing is lengthy and expensive. Genome editing brought the promise of specific and efficient insertion of large transgenes into target cells using homology-directed repair5,6. Here we developed a CRISPR-Cas9 genome-targeting system that does not require viral vectors, allowing rapid and efficient insertion of large DNA sequences (greater than one\u00a0kilobase) at specific sites in the genomes of primary human T cells, while preserving cell viability and function. This permits individual or multiplexed modification of endogenous genes. First, we applied this strategy to correct a pathogenic IL2RA mutation in cells from patients with monogenic autoimmune disease, and demonstrate improved signalling function. Second, we replaced the endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) locus with a new TCR that redirected T cells to a cancer antigen. The resulting TCR-engineered T cells specifically recognized tumour antigens and mounted productive anti-tumour cell responses in vitro and in vivo. Together, these studies provide preclinical evidence that non-viral genome targeting can enable rapid and flexible experimental manipulation and therapeutic engineering of primary human immune cells.PMID: 29995861 DOI: 10.1038/s41586-018-0326-5 ShareLinkOut - more resourcesFull Text SourcesNature Publishing GroupResearch MaterialsGet Article's Plasmids - Addgene - Addgene Non-profit plasmid repository"]}
